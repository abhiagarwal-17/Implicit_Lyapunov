# Implicit_Lyapunov

## Getting started: 

We use `pydrake` with `MOSEK`. In order to use `MOSEK`, please [build pydrake from source](https://drake.mit.edu/from_source.html)

Other dependencies include `scipy`. Everything else is installed with `pydrake`. 

## Structure of the Repo
Please use `Initial Implicit Examples.ipynb` for the 1D system, pendulum, and cart-pole examples. Use the `Acrobot.py` files to obstain the Acrobot certification (with/ without limits).
